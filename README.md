#PyBer Challenge

## Overview

For this summary, we have been asked to prepare a report for the V.Isualize, CEO of a ride sharing company who is interested in summary data of operations based on city types. For this analysis we will create a summary data frame which will allow us to view data by city type (rural, suburban, urban). We will also create a multi-line graph which will allow us to analyze the total weekly fare for each type of city. The report below summarizes differences in the data by city type and how these differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Both the Summary DataFrame and Per week DataFrame contain ride sharing data for each city type. 
The Summary DataFrame contains data from 01/01/2019 to 05/08/19 in the following areas:

-Total Rides
-Total Drivers
-Total Fares
-Average Fare Per Ride
-Average Fare Per Driver

The Per week DataFrame displays total fare data by city type for each week starting 01/01/2019 and ending 04/29/2019.

## Results Summary DataFrame – By City Type

•	The total number of rides and drivers follow similar patterns. Rural areas are less populated and had fewer rides during this time period. As expected, more heavily populated areas such as suburban and urban cities had the most rides during this time. 

•	As we look at the data starting with the urban cities, we notice there are more rides and drivers. Many urban cities over more public transportation options, however this does vary city by city. Many people who live in more densely populated cities pay more for housing therefore leaving limited options for owning a vehicle. Additionally, many people who may be accessing the ride sharing platform may be individuals visiting from other cities who have chosen to use this service instead of dealing with the challenges of renting a vehicle while they are in town. 

•	The number of drivers for suburban and rural are lower than the ride count. Whereas the number of drivers for the urban cities is greater than the ride count. With the higher cost of living, more people may look to ride sharing as a “side hustle” or a way to make money quickly when they need it.

•	Because families living in rural areas must travel further distances to arrive at stores or shopping centers, it would come as no surprise that when comparing average fares per ride for each city type, rural areas have the highest average. 

•	Rural drivers earn on average more than $10 per ride than urban drivers, although only generating less than 1/10th of the total fares drivers from urban areas were able to generate.

•	Average fare per driver was the highest for rural drivers. This follows a similar pattern to average fare per rider. With fewer drivers and longer distances destination locations, on average, rural drivers earn $15 more than suburban and $45 more than urban drivers.

•	Although there are more rides generating from urban areas, there are many more drivers to provide those rides than needed. I wonder what number of drivers are “active”? Is the data provided inclusive of all drivers who have ever registered to drive, or only active drivers? This may provide a better understanding of what the data is/isn’t telling us.

## Multi-Line Chart

•	This multiple line chart just displays total fares by city type by week. The line chart helps allows us to observe trends that occur during this time. One observation I noticed is the reduction in fares for rural areas in January. For the last week in April, we also see peeks for each city type. Followed by reductions across all areas at the beginning of March. There is also more sporadic movement in urban areas starting around this time. his same drop in total fares did not occur for suburban and urban areas. Further investigation may be necessary to determine possible reasons for dip in data.

# Business Recommendations

## Know Drivers Better

PyBer has an opportunity to help grow the company by getting to know who is driving for them better. Collecting data on the people who are driving for them may help them to determine ways to incentivize drivers to work at times when the return is greatest. For example, maybe a program that would identify drivers by city type and provide a ride tip for any ride that begins in a rural area. This may increase the number of drivers available for rural riders, while also reducing the competition for riders amongst urban drivers. 

## Increasing Usage in Rural Areas

PyBer’s marketing team may consider cost vs. benefit of advertising its’ app in rural areas. PyBer may have a ready workforce of people interested in making additional money, that may not be aware of this type of service. Recruiting more drivers who live in rural areas may be a way to expand the rural market, however doing so, may push urban drivers to remain in a saturated market. An add campaign that provided ideas for how the service might be utilized may be needed. The idea of ride sharing may require some defining as residents who live in these areas may find the idea a little outside the norm for their liking.

## Driver Dashboard

PyBer may also consider developing a system that both notifies drivers when and where there is a need for drivers. With there being a surplus of drivers for the urban areas, it may be beneficial for drivers to consider venturing to more suburban and rural areas to locate riders. This may help PyBer to meet the needs of riders in more rural/suburban areas, while also retaining driver services over time. Informing drivers with data that allowed them to make better decisions on where and when they can earn the highest income will demonstrate to drivers how much PyBer values their time and service to the company.
